# RDMA example

A simple RDMA server client example. The code contains a lot of comments. Here is the workflow that happens in the example: 

Client: 
  1. setup RDMA resources   
  2. connect to the server 
  3. receive server side buffer information via send/recv exchange 
  4. do an RDMA write to the server buffer from a (first) local buffer. The content of the buffer is the string passed with the `-s` argument. 
  5. do an RDMA read to read the content of the server buffer into a second local buffer. 
  6. compare the content of the first and second buffers, and match them. 
  7. disconnect 

Server: 
  1. setup RDMA resources 
  2. wait for a client to connect 
  3. allocate and pin a server buffer
  4. accept the incoming client connection 
  5. send information about the local server buffer to the client 
  6. wait for disconnect

###### How to run      
```text
git clone https://github.com/animeshtrivedi/rdma-example.git
cd ./rdma-example
cmake .
make
``` 
 
###### server
```text
./bin/rdma_server
```
###### client
```text
atr@atr:~/rdma-example$ ./bin/rdma_client -a 127.0.0.1 -s textstring 
Passed string is : textstring , with count 10 
Trying to connect to server at : 127.0.0.1 port: 20886

## Does not have an RDMA device?
In case you do not have an RDMA device to test the code, you can setup SofitWARP software RDMA device on your Linux machine.
